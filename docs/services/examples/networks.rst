Before you start using examples, be sure to enter your username and API key and store them locally by running the ``rack configure`` command. For more information, see :ref:`installation_and_configuration`.

You can get help for any command and its options by adding ``--help`` to the series of commands::

    $ rack networks network create --help


.. note::

    Examples will be added as new features are added to the Rackspace CLI.
